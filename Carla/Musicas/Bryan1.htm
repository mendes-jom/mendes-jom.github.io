<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt" lang="PT"><font face="Arial" size="3">I
got my first real six-string<br>
Bought it at the five-and-dime<br>
Played it til my fingers bled<br>
It was the summer of '69<br>
<br>
Me and some guys from school<br>
Had a band and we tried real hard<br>
Jimmy quit and Jody got married<br>
I shoulda known we'd never get far<br>
<br>
Oh when I look back now<br>
That summer seemed to last forever<br>
And if I had the choice<br>
Ya - I'd always wanna be there<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
<br>
Ain't no use in complainin'<br>
When you got a job to do<br>
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in<br>
And that's when I met you<br>
<br>
Standin' on your Mama's porch<br>
You told me that you'd wait forever<br>
Oh and when you held my hand<br>
I knew that it was now or never<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
Back in the summer of '69<br>
<br>
Man we were killin' time<br>
We were young and restless<br>
We needed to unwind<br>
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no<br>
<br>
And now the times are changin'<br>
Look at everything that's come and gone<br>
Sometimes when I play that old six-string<br>
I think about ya wonder what went wrong<br>
<br>
Standin' on your Mama's porch<br>
You told me it would last forever<br>
Oh the way you held my hand<br>
I knew that it was now or never<br>
Those were the best days of my life<br>
Back in the summer of '69</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><o:p>
