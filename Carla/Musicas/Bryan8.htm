- thinkin' about all our younger years<br>
There was only you and me<br>
We were young and wild and free<br>
Now nothin' can take you away from me<br>
We've been down that road before<br>
But that's over now<br>
You keep me comin' back for more<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Baby you're all that I want<br>
When you're lyin' here in my arms<br>
I'm findin' it hard to believe<br>
We're in heaven<br>
And love is all that I need<br>
And I found it here in your heart<br>
It isn't too hard to see<br>
We're in heaven<br>
<br>
Oh - once in your life you find someone<br>
Who will turn your world around<br>
Bring you up when you're feelin' down<br>
Ya-nothin' could change what you mean to me<br>
Oh there's lots that I could say<br>
But just hold me now<br>
Cause our love will light the way<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
I've been waitin' for so long<br>
For somethin' to arrive<br>
For love to come along<br>
Now our dreams are comin' true<br>
Through the good times and the bad<br>
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you</span></font>
