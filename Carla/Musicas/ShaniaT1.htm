I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart&nbsp;<br>
But you've got being right down to an art&nbsp;<br>
You think you're a genius--you drive me up the wall&nbsp;<br>
You're a regular original, a know-it-all&nbsp;<br>
<br>
BRIDGE:&nbsp;<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special&nbsp;<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
So you got the brain but have you got the touch&nbsp;<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright&nbsp;<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket&nbsp;<br>
And a comb up his sleeve--just in case&nbsp;<br>
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it&nbsp;<br>
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(BRIDGE)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
So you got the looks but have you got the touch&nbsp;<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright&nbsp;<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine&nbsp;<br>
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in&nbsp;<br>
I can't believe you kiss your car good night&nbsp;<br>
C'mon baby tell me--you must be jokin', right!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(BRIDGE)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Okay, so you've got a car&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
So you got the moves but have you got the touch&nbsp;<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright&nbsp;<br>
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night&nbsp;<br>
<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
You think you're cool but have you got the touch&nbsp;<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright&nbsp;<br>
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me much&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something...&nbsp;<br>
Whatever&nbsp;<br>
That don't impress me </font></p>
