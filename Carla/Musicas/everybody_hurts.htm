When the day is long and the night, the night is yours alone,<br>
when you're sure you've had enough of this life, well hang on.<br>
Don't let yourself go, everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes.<br>
<br>
Sometimes everything is wrong. Now it's time to sing along.<br>
When your day is night alone, (hold on, hold on)<br>
if you feel like letting go, (hold on)<br>
when you think you've had too much of this life, well hang on.<br>
<br>
Everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends.<br>
Everybody hurts. Don't throw your hand. Oh, no. Don't throw your hand.<br>
If you feel like you're alone, no, no, no, you are not alone<br>
<br>
If you're on your own in this life, the days and nights are long,<br>
when you think you've had too much of this life to hang on.<br>
<br>
Well, everybody hurts sometimes,<br>
everybody cries. And everybody hurts sometimes.<br>
And everybody hurts sometimes. So, hold on, hold on.<br>
Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on. (repeat &amp; fade)<br>
(Everybody hurts. You are not alone.)<br style="mso-special-character:line-break">
