<p class="Blockquote"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US">There
was a game we used to play<br>
We would hit the town on Friday night<br>
And stay in bed until Sunday<br>
We used to be so free<br>
We were living for the love we had and<br>
Living not for reality<br>
<br>
It was just my imagination x3<br>
<br>
There was a time I used to pray<br>
I have always kept my faith in love<br>
It's the greatest thing from the man above<br>
<br>
The game I used to play<br>
I've always put my cards upon the table<br>
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable<br>
<br>
It was just my imagination x3<br>
<br>
There is a game I like to play<br>
I like to hit the town on Friday night<br>
And stay in bed until Sunday<br>
We'll always be this free<br>
We will be living for the love we have<br>
Living not for reality<br>
It's not my imagination x3 Not my x18<o:p>
